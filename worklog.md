Task ID: fix-firefox
Agent: Bug-Fix Agent
Task: Fix critical and high-severity Firefox extension bugs (F-01, F-03, F-04, F-06, F-07, F-10)

Work Log:
- F-01 (CRITICAL): Added auto-invocation IIFE to `cors-handler.js` — `installCORSHandler()` now runs automatically when loaded as a background script via the manifest scripts array
- F-02 (CRITICAL): No code change needed — F-01 fix eliminates the need for bootstrap-firefox.js dead code path
- F-03 (CRITICAL): Updated build-extension.sh patch section — changed grep pattern to `installCORSHandler`, updated comment to reflect that cors-handler.js auto-installs via manifest scripts order
- F-04 (HIGH): Added `https://unpkg.com` to CSP `script-src` in manifest.firefox.json, allowing fallback CDN scripts
- F-06 (HIGH): Restricted `web_accessible_resources` from `<all_urls>` with `["icons/*", "src/ai/ai-worker.js"]` to only `["icons/*"]` scoped to 8 specific domain match patterns
- F-07 (MEDIUM): Removed empty `"gecko_android": {}` from `browser_specific_settings` in manifest.firefox.json
- F-10 (MEDIUM): Guarded `chrome.storage.local.get` and `.set` polyfills against non-Promise returns with `typeof result.then === 'function'` check

Stage Summary:
- **6 bugs fixed** across 4 files in the Firefox extension
- All fixes applied in-place, no new files created
- manifest.firefox.json validated as valid JSON after edits

Task ID: fix-frontend
Agent: fix-frontend
Task: Fix 9 critical/high/medium frontend bugs

Work Log:
- Read all target files, verified each bug condition, applied fixes in-place
- BUG #1: Removed duplicate `<SakuFullPage />` from AppShell overlay area in `page.tsx` (kept only the one in ToolRouter case 'saku')
- BUG #2: Changed `role: 'assistant'` → `role: 'system'` for the system prompt message in `saku-full-page.tsx:123`
- BUG #3: Added `@config "../../tailwind.config.ts";` directive after `@import "tailwindcss";` in `globals.css` to load tailwindcss-animate plugin in v4. Confirmed `tw-animate-css` v1.3.5 installed and `tailwindcss-animate` in tailwind.config.ts plugins.
- BUG #4: Added missing `#` prefix: `border-[E05252]/30` → `border-[#E05252]/30` in `dashboard-tool.tsx:53`
- BUG #5: Added `relative` to parent div: `className="flex items-center gap-2"` → `className="relative flex items-center gap-2"` for the share dropdown container in `settings-tool.tsx:432`
- BUG #6: Changed useEffect dependency `[state]` → `[]` in `use-toast.ts:185` to prevent listener accumulation on every state update
- BUG #7: Replaced `--font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);` with system mono font stack `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, 'SF Mono', Menlo, Consolas, monospace` in `globals.css:10`
- BUG #8: Removed Radix `<Toaster />` import and JSX usage from `layout.tsx`, kept only `<SonnerToaster />` (the app uses showToast() which goes through Sonner)
- BUG #9: Rewrote `db.ts` with DATABASE_URL guard — PrismaClient only instantiated when DATABASE_URL exists, log only enabled in development, added `isDbAvailable()` helper

Stage Summary:
- **9 bugs fixed** across 8 files
- 2 CRITICAL, 5 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM severity
- All fixes applied in-place, no new files created

Task ID: fix-worker
Agent: fix-worker
Task: Fix 15 critical/high/medium Worker backend bugs (#1–#14, #16)

Work Log:
- BUG #1 (CRITICAL): Removed `X-User-Plan` header trust in rate limiter — clients could spoof plan header to bypass limits. Now always uses `RATE_LIMITS.trial`.
- BUG #2 (CRITICAL): Added missing `validSizes` array constant before its first usage in `images.ts:23` — was causing ReferenceError at runtime.
- BUG #3 (CRITICAL): Changed `vectorsDB.insert(` to `vectorsDB.upsert(` in `embeddings.ts:213` — CloudFlare Vectorize has no `insert()` method.
- BUG #4 (CRITICAL): Fixed queue email retry handler in `index.ts:237-239` — was calling non-existent `sendEmailFallback()`. Now correctly calls `sendEmail(env, body.payload || body)` matching the actual lib/email.ts signature.
- BUG #5 (HIGH): Changed `tx.metadata?.user_id` → `tx.metadata?.userId` in 2 places in `payments.ts` — the initialize endpoint sends camelCase `userId` in metadata, so verify and webhook must read it back as `userId`.
- BUG #6 (HIGH): Fixed all 4 occurrences of `data.error.message` in `auth.ts` — replaced with `typeof data.error === 'string' ? data.error : data.error?.message || 'Auth error'` to handle both string and object error shapes from Supabase/GoTrue.
- BUG #7 (HIGH): Removed `/api/auth` from rate-limit bypass in `index.ts:81` — auth routes were completely unrate-limited, enabling brute-force attacks. Now only webhook and health check skip rate limiting.
- BUG #8 (HIGH): Fixed signUp and signIn response parsing in `auth.ts` — now handles raw GoTrue responses with `access_token`/`refresh_token` top-level fields, with fallback to `data.session` and `data.user`.
- BUG #9 (HIGH): Removed broken `sendEmail()` call with empty `to: ''` in `audit.ts` — would silently fail or error. Commented out import and call with TODO to resolve user email from context.
- BUG #10 (HIGH): Merged duplicate `import { rotateKey }` and `import { geminiChat }` from `../lib/fallback` into single combined import in `translate.ts`.
- BUG #11 (HIGH): Changed `bucketType: 'allPrivate'` → `bucketType: 'all'` in `fallback-storage.ts:207` — B2 `b2_list_buckets` was filtering to only private buckets, missing public buckets.
- BUG #12 (MEDIUM): Changed Supabase realtime WebSocket URL to prefer `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` over `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` and removed `&channel=` query param in `fallback-realtime.ts:123` — was exposing service key to clients.
- BUG #13 (MEDIUM): Changed OpenRouter fallback model from `openai/clip-vision-large-patch14-336` (CLIP, not a chat model) to `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` in `vision.ts:139`.
- BUG #14 (MEDIUM): Added `credentials: false` to dev-mode CORS fallback in `index.ts:62` — `origin: '*'` with `credentials: true` is invalid per spec and browsers reject it.
- BUG #16 (MEDIUM): Changed `TRANSCRIPT: -1` to `TRANSCRIPT: 604800` (7 days) in `cache.ts:21` — TTL of -1 caused permanent caching with no expiration.

Stage Summary:
- **15 bugs fixed** across 10 files in the Worker backend
- 4 CRITICAL, 6 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM severity
- All fixes applied in-place, no new files created
